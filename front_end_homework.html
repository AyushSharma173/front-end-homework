      <h3>Stock Predictions App&nbsp;</h3>
      <p>Our initial aim was to create a stock predictions app which would help a user make decisions on which stocks to buy based on his or her preference of industry. We also decided to do Natural Language Processing of reddit and twitter data of relevant stocks to predict(to some extent) whether the sentiment around those companies was positive or negative. Due to time constraints &amp; other issues, we could only make a basic app which fetches data from the yahoo finance API, preprocesses that data &amp; shows the stock trend in moving averages &amp; deviation around the mean through beautiful line graphs.</p>
      <p><strong>Front End&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p>HTML &amp; CSS was used along with aid of Adobe Dreamweaver for page design. Bootstrap was heavily used to make the page pretty. We used Javascript JQuery to make the page dynamic(like clicking on the sidebar would make it pop in and out) Amcharts are open-source graph making library for Javascript and we used it to create all 3 charts. &nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Backend&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p>We are fetching the data from the Yahoo finance python package We preprocessing the data -by standardizing and normalizing the each of the columns. We used machine learning algorithms from the sklearn libraries like linear regression, KNN, Quadratic regression, lasso regression, Bayesian ridge, support vector and some others. We take approximately 10 percent of the data from the last date the user chooses in his date range and forecast that 10% and tell the predictions along with the confidence of the respective algorithms. &nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Future Goals&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Currently, as we are fetching the data from the in build yahoo library, we could only get data from 1972 to 2019, and hence can’t really make future predictions. We expect to make this app fetch data from other finance API’s and also add features like the user’s choice of industry and displaying only the hottest stocks in that category that are expected to go up according to our predictions. We are also interested in using LSTM(Long Short term memory algorithm) for predictions as it is believed to be much better for time series data like stocks. Instead of displaying predictions of all algorithms separately, we can also generate predictions as a mean or weighted sum based on confidence of an ensemble of different machine learning models. &nbsp;</p>
